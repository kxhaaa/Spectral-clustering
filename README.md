# Spectral Clustering based on Nystrom method
**Group Members: Xianghan Kong, Hao Wang, Weishen Li**

## 1. About The Project

This project is our ENGN 8535 research project based on spectral clustering for color image segmentation.
Besides, we have also implement Kernel K-means and Watershed algorithms. And a sample result is shown as below.
