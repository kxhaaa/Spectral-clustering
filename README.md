# Spectral Clustering based on Nystrom method
**Group Members: Xianghan Kong, Hao Wang, Weishen Li**

## 1. About The Project

This project is our ENGN 8535 research project based on spectral clustering for color image segmentation.
Besides, we have also implement Kernel K-means and Watershed algorithms. And a sample result is shown as below.

## 2. Getting Started

### Pakages
numpy, opencv, sklearn, matplotlib, time, random, collections, argparse

### Usage
#### 2.1 Spectral clustering
Run `main_classic.py` for classic spectral clustering and `main_spectral.py` for Nystrom approximation.
#### 2.2 Watershed
Run `watershed.py` for applying the watershed segmentation on the given image.
#### 2.3 Kernel K-means
Please wait sooner.
